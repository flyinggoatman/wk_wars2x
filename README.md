# Wraith ARS 2X

The **Wraith ARS 2X** (Wraith Advanced Radar System) is a realistic police radar inspired by the real Stalker DSR 2X radar system. It features enhanced realism and experience, including a plate reader that scans vehicles in front and behind the patrol vehicle. The Wraith ARS 2X tracks both large, slower vehicles and smaller, faster targets, displaying speeds of up to four targets simultaneously when both antennas are active. Developers can also hook into the scanner to link it to other resources.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/flyinggoatman/wk_wars2x/releases).
2. Place the `wk_wars2x` folder into your server's resource folder.
3. Add `ensure wk_wars2x` to your server configuration file.

Your server should now be set up to use the Wraith ARS 2X.

## Script ConfigurationAll configurations are done inside the `config.lua` file. Key options include setting default key binds, configuring operator menu defaults, and adjusting UI scale and safe zone.

### Key Configuration

```lua
-- Default key binds
CONFIG.keyDefaults = {
    remote_control = "f5",
    key_lock = "l",
    front_lock = "numpad8",
    rear_lock = "numpad5",
    plate_front_lock = "numpad9",
    plate_rear_lock = "numpad6",
    copy_front_plate = "numpad1",
    copy_rear_plate = "numpad3"
}
```

### Operator Menu Defaults

```lua
-- Default values for the operator menu
CONFIG.menuDefaults = {
    fastDisplay = true,     -- Display faster targets
    same = 0.6,             -- Same lane sensitivity
    opp = 0.6,              -- Opposite lane sensitivity
    beep = 0.6,             -- Audible beep volume
    voice = 0.6,            -- Verbal lock confirmation volume
    plateAudio = 0.6,       -- Plate reader audio volume
    speedType = "mph",      -- Speed unit (mph or kmh)
    fastLock = false,       -- Automatic speed locking
    fastLimit = 60          -- Speed limit for automatic locking
}
```

### UI Scale and Safe Zone

```lua
-- UI scale and safe zone configuration
CONFIG.uiDefaults = {
    scale = {
        radar = 0.75,
        remote = 0.75,
        plateReader = 0.75
    },
    safezone = 20  -- Safe zone size
}
```
